# Exam-pizzeria-Bella-DS3801
Frontend design for Pizzeria Bella



Home exam, individual or in groups of up to 5 students
Notice:
-   The main topics in this exam are interface design, prototyping, user experience and
    implementation using Frontend framework as given through the course. The
    implementation should be the manifestation of the design work and should be done
    after all the design work, which is the main priority, is done.
-   In the case of Frontend frameworks, use the technologies you have learnt in this
    course to solve the case. i.e., React + CSS.
-   All code should be coded by you. Except for in very special and concrete cases, you
    can’t copy paste code that is not yours. You should consult if unsure on this point.
-   Any resources used, citations and references must be stated clearly, both in text and
    in reference list.
-   You should put all the files which the delivery contains in one folder which you zip
    before uploading to WISEFlow.
-   Groups will register and deliver together on the same group in WISEFlow.
-   If you are unsure about something regarding the exam you should ask the teacher to
    clarify.

CASE TO SOLVE: PIZZERIA BELLA

Pizzeria Bella is a fictive Italian restaurant. They want to design their online food ordering
system, which can present pizza and pasta menus to customers and help to place an order.
The layout shall be responsive to Mobile, Tablet and Desktop versions.

Notice:
-   The main focus is on design.
-   This is a pure Frontend exam. Additional functionality, ex. backend, database, is not
    part of the scope.
    
Functionality:
-   Be able to present an overview of Pizza and Pasta products that you can order.
-   Be able to add products to shopping cart and present the total number of ordered
    items and total price.
-   Shopping cart is editable, i.e., edit quantity of products, delete products, etc.
-   Be able to place an order.
-   Be able to navigate between web pages and edit your order before final order is
    placed.
-   And other selective features you think practical in this context. For example, a
    dropdown shopping-cart menu; or side dishes suggestions while ordering.
-   None of the functionalities requires backend.

Website layout:
Suggested application layout at least includes below navigation pages:
-   Home page
-   Product page/pages. Add to cart- function for each product.
-   Checkout page. It shall include 1) a shopping cart; 2) a mock-up section that contains
    payment alternatives and shipping options; and 3) a mock-up “place an order”
    button.
-   Note that you can have a separate shopping cart page too.
    You decide how many and what products will be placed in the menu and present to the
    customer. You have a lot of freedom regarding the content of the page. However, the
    solution shall present good enough scope and complexity. For example, it is expected that
    the solution should include 8-10 products for both Pizza and Pasta menus. The main point is
    to get a prototype that can show the complexity of a solution that is close to reality.
      
      
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DELIVER?
Based on the techniques you learned in the course when solving the following four
challenges shall be delivered in WISEFlow. Note that both design and implementation have
to be done on a much smaller/easier scale as compared to ordinary implementation.

1. A report that includes

a. Description of design process and solution
b. Evaluation of the solution
c. Description and reflection of the applied methodology, purpose, observations
and recommendations

2. A zipped folder that contains the technical solution

The report part shall not be more than 5-7 pages, including any Sketches and prototyping
files. The most important thing is that you show reflection and good knowledge in design
theory.
Other details
- The solution should be responsive in the following manner with help of CSS3 Grid and
Media queries:
• Mobile (0-576px): 1 column of information
• Tablet (577-970px): 2 or 3 columns of information
• Desktop (971+ px): 3 or 4 columns of information
- There are three layouts (three breakpoints) required in this exam.

ASSESSMENT CRITERIA, FOR STUDENTS AND ASSESSORS.
The following will be the main points to assessed:
• Interface design theory and implementation are what is assessed in this exam.
• Persona – Identify user group; Create a persona for each user group
• Prototyping – Convert ideas to tangible form
• Usability – Revise the project according to user feedback
• Accessibility / Universal design – It should reflect good universal design principles,
i.e., font size, contrast, color, images, links, etc.
• Frontend framework – React + CSS
• It is expected that a group of 3 will be able to create more than a group of 1
Guideline for how much each part counts
The percentage numbers below present approximate numbers on how much each part will
count
- Persona: ca. 10%
- Prototyping: ca. 30%
- User testing: ca. 10%
- Accessibility/Universal design: ca. 10%
- Frontend implementation of the design: ca 30%
- *Amount of code and complexity: ca. 10%
*All points affect each other. The assessment will require a holistic view of techniques
applied in the exam delivery.
